# Requests and lifecycle

> Understand asynchronous generation requests and their terminal states.

Generation is asynchronous. A successful submission creates a request and returns immediately while the work continues in the background.

## Request lifecycle

| Status | Terminal | Meaning |
| - | :-: | - |
| `queued` | No | The request is waiting to start and may still be canceled. |
| `in_progress` | No | Generation has started and can no longer be canceled. |
| `completed` | Yes | Output URLs are available in the response. |
| `failed` | Yes | Generation failed. The response may include an `error`. |
| `nsfw` | Yes | Input or output was rejected by content moderation. |
| `canceled` | Yes | The request was canceled before processing started. |

Store the `request_id` as soon as a request is accepted. It is the stable identifier used by polling, cancellation, webhook deduplication, and support.

## Initial response

```json theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
{
  "status": "queued",
  "request_id": "d7e6c0f3-6699-4f6c-bb45-2ad7fd9158ff",
  "status_url": "https://api.higgsfield.ai/requests/d7e6c0f3-6699-4f6c-bb45-2ad7fd9158ff/status",
  "cancel_url": "https://api.higgsfield.ai/requests/d7e6c0f3-6699-4f6c-bb45-2ad7fd9158ff/cancel"
}
```

Use the URLs from the response instead of constructing them manually.

## Completed output

The output field depends on the model's output type.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Image theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
  {
    "status": "completed",
    "request_id": "d7e6c0f3-6699-4f6c-bb45-2ad7fd9158ff",
    "images": [
      { "url": "https://cdn.example.com/image-1.jpg" },
      { "url": "https://cdn.example.com/image-2.jpg" }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ```json Video theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
  {
    "status": "completed",
    "request_id": "d7e6c0f3-6699-4f6c-bb45-2ad7fd9158ff",
    "video": {
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/video.mp4"
    }
  }
  ```

  ```json Audio theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
  {
    "status": "completed",
    "request_id": "d7e6c0f3-6699-4f6c-bb45-2ad7fd9158ff",
    "audio": {
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/audio.mp3"
    },
    "audios": [
      { "url": "https://cdn.example.com/audio.mp3" }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Some video and 3D operations can return additional artifacts such as `zip`, `mov`, `jsx`, `fbx`, or `ply`.

## Cancel a request

Cancellation is available only while every job in the request remains queued.

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.higgsfield.ai/requests/${REQUEST_ID}/cancel" \
  --header "Authorization: Key ${HF_API_KEY_ID}:${HF_API_KEY_SECRET}"
```

A successful cancellation returns `202 Accepted` with an empty body. If processing has started, the API returns `400 Bad Request`.

<Note>
  Output URLs are retained for at least seven days. Copy completed media to your own storage if you need it for longer.
